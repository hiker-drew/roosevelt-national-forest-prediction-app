# About This Website section

    st.markdown("""
    This project helps identify which types of trees grow in different areas of Roosevelt National Forest using a machine learning algorithm called CatBoost. The website could be used as an educational tool for helping understand the relationship between what specific trees/forest types prefer and the environment they most likely live in. The model also performs well enough to potentially be suitible for research and forest management. It achieved this by using topographic data such as elevation, slope, proximity to water sources, past fires, and roadways, as well as light availability and wilderness area designations in order to predict which of 7 forest types is found in any given 30m x 30m patch of land. The problem is ecologically important because different tree species create distinct habitats that support diverse wildlife communities, making forest type prediction crucial for conservation and management efforts. Click on the >> in the top left and try adjusting the forest prediction environment in order to match what each forest type prefers! (hint: elevation is key).

    The CatBoost model choosen achieves strong performance (83% F1-macro score), making it potentially suitable for ecological research and forest management efforts. A reduced feature set from 54 to 11 features was used which also eliminated the need for the 40 soil type features in the original dataset due to lack of feature importance. The findings of soil types not have much predicting power might be useful for future studies as they may not need to collect soil samples in order to achieve a similar performance. With the full dataset, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost were tried. CatBoost outperformed every model besides LightGBM, which had significant overfitting issues even after regularization efforts so it wasn't used for this project. When comparing models with the reduced feature set, two versions of CatBoost were tested: the first achieved 80.5% F1-macro score with a 6.8% performance difference between training and testing, while the second achieved 83.0% F1-macro with a 10% difference. The second model was choosen for this website because it performed better on test data for every class (in particular Lodgepole Pine and Douglas-fir with an F1 increase above 5%); however, both versions are available in the GitHub repository.

    The model and dataset are specifically based on Roosevelt National Forest in northern Colorado. Therefore, the predictions are tailored to this study area's unique environmental conditions and may not generalize to other geographic regions with different micro-climates or topography. This level of precision makes the model much more suitble for local forest management decisions and research while also being able to be used as an educational tool for understanding how environmental factors influence forest cover types in Roosevelt National Forest.

    🏔️ Elevation: 2,525-3,675m  
    A multi-tree forest found in subalpine areas experience cold temperatures year-round where precipitation is usually snowfall and can even last into mid-summer.
    
    **2. Lodgepole Pine**  
    🏔️ Elevation: 2,169-3,413m  
    Their serotinous cones are adapted so that their sealing resin melts during a fire. These seeds are then in ideal conditions for sprouting roots with a bright open canopy and clear forest floor.
    
    **3. Ponderosa Pine**  
    🏔️ Elevation: 1,903-2,850m  
    Mature trees have thick bark, open crowns, and self-pruning limbs that help the tree's fire resistance in common forest fires.
    
    **4. Cottonwood/Willow**  
    🏔️ Elevation: 1,989-2,526m  
    Both species are found along rivers and streams where broken branches can go downriver and form the roots of new trees.

    **5. Aspen**  
    🏔️ Elevation: 2,482-3,007m  
    Deciduous trees known for their vibrant fall colors grow in large clonal colonies connected by shared root systems, making each grove a single organism. A pioneer species that quickly colonizes burned areas, but also requires abundant sunshine.
    
    **6. Douglas-fir**  
    🏔️ Elevation: 1,863-2,883m  
    Adaptable to diverse climates from coastal maritime conditions to harsh mountain environments. Important timber tree and is grown as a Christmas tree. Douglas-fir adapts to different slope aspects based on sunlight and moisture availability. Though the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir are also versatile they are only found within the Rocky Mountains.
    
    **7. Krummholz**  
    🏔️ Elevation: 2,870-3,849m  
    At alpine elevations with harsh and icy winds, trees become a krummholz form where their leaves grow like a flag shape or could be protected behind rocks.
