# About This Website section
with st.expander("‚ÑπÔ∏è About This Website"):
    st.markdown("""
    This project helps identify which types of trees grow in different areas of Roosevelt National Forest using a machine learning algorithm called CatBoost. The website is an educational tool for helping understand the relationship between a tree's adapted preferences and the environment they most likely are found in within the park. The model also performs well enough to potentially be suitible for research and forest management. It achieved this by using topographic data such as elevation, slope, proximity to water sources, past fires, and roadways, as well as light availability and wilderness area designations in order to predict which of 7 forest types is found in any given 30m x 30m patch of land. The problem is ecologically important because different tree species create distinct habitats that support diverse wildlife communities, making forest type prediction crucial for conservation and management efforts. Click on the >> in the top left and try adjusting the forest prediction environment in order to match what each forest type prefers! (hint: elevation is key).

    The model and dataset are specifically based on Roosevelt National Forest in northern Colorado. Therefore, the predictions are tailored to this study area's unique environmental conditions and may not generalize to other geographic regions with different micro-climates or topography. This level of precision makes the model more suitble for local forest management decisions and research while also being able to be used as an educational tool for understanding how environmental factors influence forest cover types in Roosevelt National Forest.

    **1. Spruce/Fir**  
    üèîÔ∏è Elevation: 2,525-3,675m  
    A multi-tree forest found in subalpine areas, experience cold temperatures year-round where precipitation is usually snowfall and can even last into July and August.
    
    **2. Lodgepole Pine**  
    üèîÔ∏è Elevation: 2,169-3,413m  
    Their serotinous cones are adapted so that their sealing resin melts during a fire. These seeds are then in ideal conditions for germination, sprouting roots with a bright open canopy and clear forest floor. A Lodgepole Pine's cone can wait decades for a chance for their seeds to take root.
    
    **3. Ponderosa Pine**  
    üèîÔ∏è Elevation: 1,903-2,850m  
    Mature trees have thick bark, open crowns, and self-pruning limbs that help the tree's fire resistance in common forest fires.
    
    **4. Cottonwood/Willow**  
    üèîÔ∏è Elevation: 1,989-2,526m  
    Both species are found along rivers and streams where broken branches can go downriver and form the roots of new trees.

with col2:
    st.markdown("""
    **5. Aspen**  
    üèîÔ∏è Elevation: 2,482-3,007m  
    Deciduous trees known for their vibrant fall colors grow in large clonal colonies connected by shared root systems, making each grove a single organism. A pioneer species that quickly colonizes burned areas, but also requires abundant sunshine and are favored along roads.
    
    **6. Douglas-fir**  
    üèîÔ∏è Elevation: 1,863-2,883m  
    Adaptable to diverse climates from coastal maritime conditions to harsh mountain environments. Important timber tree and is grown as a Christmas tree. Douglas-fir adapts to different slope aspects based on sunlight and moisture availability. Though the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir are also versatile they are only found within the Rocky Mountains.
    
    **7. Krummholz**  
    üèîÔ∏è Elevation: 2,870-3,849m  
    At alpine elevations with harsh and icy winds, trees become a krummholz form where they grow in flag shapes sculpted by the wind and are found being protected behind rocks.
